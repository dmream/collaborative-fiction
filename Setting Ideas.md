**## Story setting ideas:**

A world where incomprehensibly advanced technology is used to create what we would call supernatural effects in order to confound humanity's knowledge of science and prevent industrialization, therefore controlling the human population and its impact on Earth’s environment.



A particle physics lab where a researcher has discovered a way to send bits of information to himself from the future, but only if he is consistent about following through and actually sending his past self the data, even when he has already exploited the data he previously got from the future. The type of person who would be tempted to see what would happen if they didn’t send the data to their past selves after successfully receiving a message from the their future self, never gets a coherent message from the future to begin with, and therefore thinks the technology doesn’t really work.



A PhD graduate student develops a breakthrough machine learning algorithm, but doesn’t want to give the university rights to the technology, and so begins scheming ways to use it to make money without revealing what he has in his possession. He discovers that keeping it a secret is much more difficult and dangerous than he ever imagined, because even though he manages to remain anonymous and keep the details of the technology secret, someone else discovers that the technology exists by observing what it is capable of, and becomes obsessed with acquiring the technology for him/herself. This other person manages to recruit various powerful government agencies to aid in uncovering the workings of the technology, which requires finding the person who created it.
